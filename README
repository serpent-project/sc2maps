Repo Of SC2 Mapping
===================

These are some maps I am working on, to test the starcraft 2 scripting environment for experimentation.

You are free to download, examine, or make the map even better, you dont even have to credit me. This does not include the allowance to publish it as your own work.

Please contact me, if you want to host maps, if they ever become that fun that they are hostable :-)

Scripts
=======

todo: andromeda files.

Resources
=========

I will add resources here, which help in understanding the dataediting behind the scenes.
